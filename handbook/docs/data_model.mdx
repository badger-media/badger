# Data Model

:::warning

This structure may be subject to change.
Follow issue [BDGR-145](https://github.com/ystv/badger/issues/277) for updates.

:::

Badger's top-level concept is a _show_, which is broken down into _rundowns_ and/or _continuity items_. Rundowns, in turn, have _rundown items_, which can be ether segments or VTs (video tapes, pre-recorded content) as well as _assets_. Both shows and rundowns can also have _metadata_. VTs, continuity items, and assets have _media_ attached.
